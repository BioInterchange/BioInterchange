Comparison of tumor specimen from MM precursor lesions, primary tumors, and metastases revealed that CD40 surface expression is down-regulated during tumor progression. CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases, whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative. CD40 expression could be enhanced in CD40-positive MM by stimulation with IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not by interleukin (IL)-1beta or CD40 triggering. CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L-transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB. Furthermore, CD40 ligation of a HLA-A2+, MelanA/MART1+ MM cell line enhanced its susceptibility to specific lysis by a HLA-A2-restricted, MelanA/MART-1-specific CTL clone. Finally, CD40 ligation induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM. These results indicate that CD40-CD40L interactions may play an important role in augmenting antitumor immunity and inducing apoptosis in some CD40-positive immunogenic human MMs.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":15,"end":19},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":23,"end":60},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":70,"end":75},"category":"PR"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":126,"end":135},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":182,"end":186},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":190,"end":221},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":299,"end":309},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":392,"end":407},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":494,"end":504},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":581,"end":596},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":768,"end":770},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":857,"end":862},"category":"PR"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":954,"end":959},"category":"PR"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1217},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1227,"end":1230},"category":"PR"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1384},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1390},"category":"NP"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1517,"end":1526},"category":"NP"}],"insanns":[],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T3","object":"T2"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T5","object":"T1"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T6","object":"T2"},{"id":"R4","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T9","object":"T7"},{"id":"R5","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T10","object":"T8"},{"id":"R6","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T11","object":"T6"},{"id":"R7","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T12","object":"T11"},{"id":"R8","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T13","object":"T11"},{"id":"R9","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T15","object":"T14"},{"id":"R10","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T16","object":"T4"},{"id":"R11","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T17","object":"T11"},{"id":"R12","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T18","object":"T16"}],"modanns":[]}
