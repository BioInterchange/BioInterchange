Comparison of tumor specimen from MM precursor lesions, primary tumors, and metastases revealed that CD40 surface expression is down-regulated during tumor progression. CD40 expression was confirmed in 7 human MM cell lines established from immunogenic primary tumors or metastases, whereas 11 cell lines established from advanced stages were CD40 negative. CD40 expression could be enhanced in CD40-positive MM by stimulation with IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not by interleukin (IL)-1beta or CD40 triggering. CD40 ligation on MM by CD40L-transfected murine L-cells or by a soluble CD40L fusion protein up-regulated their expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and MHC class I and class II molecules and their secretion of IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-a, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and also induced a rapid activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB. Furthermore, CD40 ligation of a HLA-A2+, MelanA/MART1+ MM cell line enhanced its susceptibility to specific lysis by a HLA-A2-restricted, MelanA/MART-1-specific CTL clone. Finally, CD40 ligation induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MM. These results indicate that CD40-CD40L interactions may play an important role in augmenting antitumor immunity and inducing apoptosis in some CD40-positive immunogenic human MMs.\n","catanns":[{"annset_id":1,"begin":1535,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1539,"id":139,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1425,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1430,"id":138,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1420,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1424,"id":137,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1331,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1335,"id":136,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1295,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1301,"id":135,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1288,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1294,"id":134,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1269,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1275,"id":133,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1198,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1203,"id":132,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1191,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1197,"id":131,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1182,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1188,"id":130,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1163,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1167,"id":129,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":1014,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1062,"id":128,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":985,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":1008,"id":127,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":979,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":983,"id":126,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":973,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":977,"id":125,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":877,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":910,"id":124,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":823,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":828,"id":123,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":774,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":779,"id":122,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":751,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":755,"id":121,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":734,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":738,"id":120,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":708,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":730,"id":119,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":669,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":696,"id":118,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":655,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":664,"id":117,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":618,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":622,"id":116,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":581,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":585,"id":115,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":566,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":570,"id":114,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":392,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":396,"id":113,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":324,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":328,"id":112,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":182,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":186,"id":111,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"},{"annset_id":1,"begin":15,"category":"Protein","created_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z","doc_id":9,"end":19,"id":110,"updated_at":"2012-07-18T06:11:50Z"}]}
